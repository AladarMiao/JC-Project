1. install Anaconda

2. conda create --name tf --file requirements.txt

3. conda activate tf

4. open the notebook in that environment, and you should be good to go


I've also included a script file for the image autoencoder in RunImageAE.py, so if you do not wish to leverage Jupyter, feel free to just run python RunImageAE.py
